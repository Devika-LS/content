
LinkShadow integrates with CortexTM XSOAR by Palo Alto Networks, to automate and optimize complex workflows across the full stack of information systems and security tools. Using the CortexTM XSOAR and LinkShadow content pack, security teams can automate the incident response and can seamlessly integrate LinkShadow with existing security tools and workflows. Thus minimizing investigation time and maximising detection and threat hunting efficacy. 

- This integration was integrated and tested with version 4.5.8 of Linkshadow.
- Enables LinkShadow to integrate with PaloAlto Cortex XSOAR Platform, It pushes Linkshadow Anomaly events to XSOAR to create a new Incident and trigger the relevant Playbook Actions.
- This pack includes configurations to combine the world-class threat detection of Linkshadow with the synchrony and automation abilities of XSOAR, allowing security teams to investigate and manage security events before they have time to escalate.
- Gathers information about every anomaly detection made by the Linkshadow platform and populates it in XSOAR.
## What does this pack do?

By integrating AI-automated threat hunting with SOAR capabilities SOC teams can unlock the power of threat hunting and tackle the most critical threats with smarter tactical decisions, at a much faster pace. 

This robust technology alliance equips security teams to: 
1.	Leverage insights by taking information from LinkShadow to coordinate security responses from 550+ Cortex XSOAR third-party product integrations. 
2.	Extend LinkShadow and XSOAR functionality to get a Modernized Cyber SecOps driven by AI-based Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms. 
3.	Increase ROI on the security investments with informed and actionable insights. 
4.	Use LinkShadow Analytics to enrich the Incident Intelligence to fully Automate Threat Hunting, and Incident Investigation, Orchestration and Response. 
5.	Improve teamâ€™s effectiveness and efficiency by minimizing the work overhead and automating the repetitive actions.
